# Specification
The function documentation and vignettes serve as the specifications for this R package. No further specification documentation is provided.

# Validation

## Edge Cases
Many cases of clearly incorrect inputs are automatically tested in this package to ensure the package correctly throws errors and warnings. The code for these edge cases can be found in th file "/tboot/tests/testthat/test-edge-cases.R". These include edge cases for the following 5 functions:

 + tweigths()
 + tboot()
 + tweights_bmr()
 + post_bmr()
 + tboot_bmr()

## Validation of 'tweights' and 'tboot'

We have the following validation approaches:

1. We require that the  weighted mean from the data using the weights from tweights should lead to the specified 'target' specified mean. This is check by tweights itself and the results are automatically printed to the screen every time the function is run unless suppressed.

2. We require that the results of tboot for large samples should be the expected target for several different scenarios. One such such scenario is found in the 'tboot' vignette. Additional scenarios are automatically checked int ....

3. We require the the the results from tboot be consistent with several theoretical expectations. This is checked in the 'exp_tilting' vignette.
