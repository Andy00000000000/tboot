# tboot


The tilted bootstrap is an approach to resampling where samples are drawn from the observed data
with some samples appearing more frequently than others. Tilted bootstraping may be used to create
simulated clinical trail data with realistic correlation structures and assumed efficacy levels.
The tilted bootstrap package may also be used for simulating a joint Bayesian distribution along
along with clinical trials based on the Bayesian distribution.
